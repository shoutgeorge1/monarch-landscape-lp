# PNW Free Mulch Promo Landing Page: Strategy Summary

**For:** Anna + Jackson / Development Team  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Transform the current "Why Mulch Matters" section into a high-conversion B2B landing page

---

## Executive Summary

We've analyzed the existing "Why Mulch Matters in the Pacific Northwest" section and recommend building a complete conversion-focused landing page around it. The current section has strong content that works well as a mid-page benefits block, but the page needs a proper hero, clear CTAs, and conversion mechanics to generate qualified leads.

**Key Recommendation:**
> Keep the "Why Mulch Matters" section — it's strong content — but wrap it in a true B2B landing page built for commercial property managers. That means: a hero with a clear "Free Mulch Proposal" CTA and form above the fold, multiple CTAs throughout the page, clear explanation of how the promo works, service areas, and strong call tracking + form tracking.
