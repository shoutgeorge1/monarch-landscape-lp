## Executive Summary

Your "Why Mulch Matters" section is strong content, but the page needs better conversion mechanics. These recommendations focus on adding strategic CTAs, improving the hero section, and clarifying the offer without rebuilding everything.

**Priority:** High-impact, low-effort improvements that can be implemented quickly.

---

## Critical Issues & Quick Wins

### 1. Hero Section Needs a Form Above the Fold ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State:**
- Form appears below the hero content
- Users have to scroll to find the lead capture

**Recommendation:**
- Move the form to the hero section (right side on desktop)
- Or add a sticky form that appears after scrolling past hero
- Keep form visible above the fold on mobile

**Impact:** This alone could increase conversions by 20-30%

---

### 2. CTA Copy is Too Generic ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current CTAs:**
- "Schedule a Consultation" (generic)
- "Discover more" (weak)

**Recommended CTAs:**
- **Primary:** "Get My Free Mulch Proposal"
- **Secondary:** "Schedule a Free Mulch Walkthrough"

**Why:** Specific, action-oriented CTAs that promise a clear deliverable convert better.

---

### 3. Missing "How It Works" Section ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State:**
- Offer is mentioned but not clearly explained
- Property managers may be confused about what "free" means

**Recommendation:**
Add a simple 3-step section:
1. Schedule a Walkthrough
2. Get a Commercial Maintenance Proposal
3. Mulch Installation Included for New Clients

**Copy to add:**
> "Offer available for qualifying commercial properties in our PNW service areas. We'll walk you through the scope and pricing before you decide."

---

### 4. No Sticky CTA (Desktop) ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

- Sticky bottom bar on mobile with Call + Form buttons

**Impact:** 15-25% increase in conversions from users who scroll
